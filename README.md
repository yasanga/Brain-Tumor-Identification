# Brain Tumor Classification Using CNN

## Project Overview
This project involves the classification of brain tumors using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The objective is to accurately classify images of brain tumors into different categories using deep learning techniques.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Building and training a CNN model
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Visualization of results

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of MRI images of brain tumors. It includes labeled data for different types of brain tumors.

## Requirements
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook


## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook brain-tumor-classification-cnn_final_test.ipynb
    ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 94% on the test dataset. The performance metrics and confusion matrix are included in the notebook.
